### Check List

Following a checklist will ensure that each target receives a certain level of testing.

It makes it very easy to keep track of what you have tested and what still needs to be looked at.

Ex: [OWASP testing guide](https://github.com/tanprathan/OWASP-Testing-Checklist)



### Notes

Your daily notes should be verbose enough that you can replicate what you have done.

A list of some ways to take notes:

* Notion bug bounty workspace / Kanban boards.
* [https://pentest.ws/](https://pentest.ws/)
* [https://github.com/ehrishirajsharma/SwiftnessX](https://github.com/ehrishirajsharma/SwiftnessX)

* [https://www.sublimetext.com/](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [https://notepad-plus-plus.org/](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

### Burp Suite Logs

If youâ€™re looking at a single application or a single endpoint and want to inspect it closely Burp is the only tool you will need and it also logs every request that is sent to and from the application.
