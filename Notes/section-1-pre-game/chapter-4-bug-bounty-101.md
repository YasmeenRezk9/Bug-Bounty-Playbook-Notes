# Chapter 4: Bug bounty 101

Remember to pay close attention to the domains that are in scope and any endpoints that are out of scope.

## Popular Bug bounty platforms

1.  #### HackerOne


2. **BugCrowd**

## Picking the right target

Large scopes, high payouts, and the age of an organization are all the features you want to look for in a bug bounty program to maximize your efforts.

#### Scope

The more domains in scope greater the chances you will run into a vulnerability.

#### Age

You will see better results testing older companies as they may have a larger footprint on the internet.

#### Payout

If youâ€™re going to be spending time finding bugs you might as well prioritize companies that have higher payouts.
