# SSRF

occurs when an attacker forces an application to make HTTP requests on their behalf.

* used to post or read data from sensitive endpoints such as AWS and Gcloud metadata service, FTP service, LDAP service, and local files.
* If you find an application hosted on Google Cloud or other cloud providers, try to read the metadata service to retrieve API keys and credentials.

#### Testing for SSRF

1. Search for requests that have a URL as a parameter value
2. If the response is reflected back, you could have a possible SSRF vulnerability.
3. change the URL to find a vulnerable endpoint on the system's local host or on an endpoint in the local network.

#### Example

* changing the “stockApi” value to an admin directory on the system's local IP
* the request will be performed by the target application against itself
* this endpoint has an admin application hosted on the local host (impossible to access from the internet)
* render the HTML response to see if you are able to access an internal admin application hosted on the target system
